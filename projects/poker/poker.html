            <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/158/poker+hand">Poker Hand Dataset</a>
            <p>The dataset used in this project is the Poker Hand dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
                The dataset contains 1,025,010 instances (25,010 for train and 1,000,000 for test), each representing a poker hand with 10 attributes (5 cards with rank and suit). 
                The goal is to predict the poker hand rank based on these attributes into 10 classes of from 0 (Nothing) to 9 (Royal Flush).</p>

            <h2>Discussions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Poor Performance with Raw Card Features (Suit and Rank)</b></li>
                <p>It is seen that <b>the models struggled to distinguish between poker hands using raw features</b> like suits and ranks directly. 
                    This is expected, as raw numerical or categorical data often lacks the necessary abstraction for models to understand complex relationships in the data.
                </p>
                <li><b>Feature Engineering (Counts and Sequential Checks)</b></li>
                <p><b>Introducing counts of cards by rank and suit, as well as checks for sequential cards, appears to have improved accuracy significantly</b> (from 49-62% to 96-99%). 
                    This aligns with the principle that good feature engineering can help models better capture domain-specific relationships, in this case, identifying pairs or straights.
                </p>
                <p>However, models are still struggling with hands that share overlapping characteristics (Straight and Flush versus Straight Flush, Three of a kind versus Four of a kind versus Full House, or even Royal Flush).
                </p>
                <li><b>Flush Feature</b></li>
                <p>With Flush problem, a logical solution is to <b>add a feature that specifically determines if a hand is a Flush</b>.
                    This will likely resolve ambiguity for Flush-related hands, including Straight Flush and Royal Flush.</p>
                <li><b>Card Counts for Higher Patterns</b></li>
                <p>Finally, <b>the addition of features for the highest and second-highest card counts</b> seems to have addressed ambiguities among Three of a Kind, Four of a Kind, and Full House.
                </p>
            </ol>
            <p>There can be other alternatives in dealing with imbalanced dataset, such as oversampling and undersampling. 
                However, for a game of poker where rules are well-defined, a meticulous feature engineering process seems easier and can lead to perfect classification results.
            </p>
            <h2>Key Observations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Feature engineering was crucial - all three models improved dramatically with better features.</li>
                <li>Stacking consistently performed better than individual models, though by a small margin once better feature engineering was introduced.</li>
                <li>The initial raw features were insufficient and the final feature set achieved perfect classification, which means tailored features can significantly enhance model performance.</li>
            </ul>
